- Always stick to the plans in [plan.md](mdc:.cursor/rules/.docs/plan.md)
- Follow each step of the plan as described in [checklist.md](mdc:.cursor/rules/.docs/checklist.md)
- carry out one step(one feature) of the plan at a time as descibed in the checklist
- Don't move to the next feature until I specifically ask you to.
- When each step is completed, tick that step in the .docs/checklist file and ask if you can proceed to the test for that feature.
- At the end of each feature, we will write tests for the new feature and test the new feature. After that, we will run older tests for previous features to make sure everything is funtioning properly.
- After the test you can ask me if you can continue with the next feature.
