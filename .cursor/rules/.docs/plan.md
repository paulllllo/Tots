**Author:** Odigbo Kelechi Paul

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the requirements for "Tots," a forum-like web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, Firebase SDK, and Tailwind CSS. Tots aims to provide a platform for users to share their tech ideas, interact with others' ideas, and build a community around innovation.

### 1.2 Goals

* Enable users to easily share their tech ideas with a wider audience.
* Facilitate interaction and discussion around shared ideas through likes and comments.
* Allow users to discover and engage with ideas based on their interests.
* Provide a personalized experience for users to manage their own ideas and profile.

### 1.3 Target Audience

The target audience for Tots includes:

* Tech enthusiasts looking for a platform to share their innovative ideas.
* Developers, designers, and other tech professionals seeking inspiration and feedback.
* Individuals interested in discovering new tech concepts and engaging in discussions.

### 1.4 Scope

This document covers the core features and functionalities of the Tots web application, including idea sharing, interaction, user authentication, and profile management. It specifically outlines the use of Firebase SDK for data persistence and authentication.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

Tots will be a standalone web application accessible through standard web browsers. It will leverage the Firebase platform for backend services, minimizing the need for custom backend development. The frontend will be built using Next.js and TypeScript for a performant and type-safe user interface, styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive design.

### 2.2 Product Features

The core features of Tots include:

* **Idea Feed:** A public-facing view displaying a list of the latest tech ideas shared by users.
* **Idea Interaction:** Buttons for users to like, comment on, and share ideas.
* **Liked Ideas:** A dedicated section for logged-in users to view their liked ideas.
* **Idea Search:** Functionality for users to search for ideas based on keywords.
* **Create Idea Post:** A modal interface for logged-in users to submit new ideas with a headline, description, and tags.
* **Post Display:** Each idea post will display the headline, a truncated description, tags, interaction buttons, and the profile picture of the user who created the post.
* **Expanded Post View:** Clicking on a post will reveal more details about the idea without navigating to a new page.
* **Post Details Page:** A dedicated page accessible via a button in the expanded post view, where users can see the full details of the idea and post comments.
* **Commenting:** Logged-in users can post comments on ideas within the post details page.
* **Comment Navigation:** Clicking on a comment icon will redirect users to the post details page of the corresponding idea.
* **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup functionality for users.
